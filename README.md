## Storyline

The game is at a very early stage. Only a couple of rooms are implemented to demonstrate the concept.  

Virtuous ruler nCtl has protected the blockchain from harm for centuries.  
Now nCtl has been compromised by The CORS.  
The blockchain is being torn apart by sweet Irish melodies.  
Only a heroic **Caspookie** can reach nCtl's mind and save the blockchain.  
Are your the chosen one?  

## Caspookie NFTs

Caspookem starts with a one room demo mode that anybody can play. To progress further in the game, the player must possess one or more Caspookies.  

A very basic NFT collection has been created. In future more variations can be added to the NFTs. The NFT changes the appearance of the character. In future different Caspookies will have different properties.  

Here are some example NFTs:
