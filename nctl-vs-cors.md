# nCtl vs. The CORS

Virtuous ruler nCtl has protected the blockchain from harm for centuries.  

Now nCtl has been compromised by The CORS.  

The blockchain is being torn apart by sweet Irish melodies.  

Only a heroic caspookie can reach nCtl's mind and save the blockchain.  

Are you the chosen one?  

## Weapons

Base it on the simple but interesting [Castlevania Weapon System](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Castlevania/Items).  

## Baddies

Limit the game to be like Castlevania / Super Mario with just a few enemies. They come running in and you've got to hit them.  If there are a few holes and things to jump over it can make it a bit more difficult.  

This video about [Hollow Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITtPPE-pXE) can be used to gather some newer ideas about game design.

Baddies try to jump on you and you have to shoot it a few times in a specfic place. Fighting 3 CORS can create a good challenge.  

* Three CORS Baddies
* Jumping Baddie
* Flying Baddie

Boss fires for a bit, then stops so you attack it. There is a time limit by spikes coming down or holes in the floor.  

## Music

The music sounds a bit like The Chain by Fleetwood Mac.
